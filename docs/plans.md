# Plans

## Ecosystem
This command interpreter was split out of a Slackbot after realizing neither should strongly depend on the other.
My current intent is to keep the interpreter as small and simple as possible and enhance its utility
mostly through embedding and integration.

# Embedding
The command interpreter should be easily embeddable in:
- other chat environments like Discord, Teams, and Webex.
- arbitrary web apps
- arbitrary mobile apps
- desktop apps
