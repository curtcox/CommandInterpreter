# Plans

## Ecosystem
This command interpreter was split out of a Slackbot after realizing neither should strongly depend on the other.
The command interpreter should be easily embeddable in:
- other chat environments like Discord, Teams, and Webex.
- arbitrary web apps
- arbitrary mobile apps
- desktop apps
